# UEShaderScript

## Discord
First things first, I have a discord server for questions, development and bugs find me here: https://discord.gg/rkkWSH2EMz

## Credits
A huge thank you to Aaron Elkins who designed Node Kit, a Blender plugin under the GPL Licence which was several years in the making. 
UEShaderScript copies a huge amount of code from Node Kit and I want to thank Aaron Elkins for his kindness 
for giving me permission to release UEShaderscript. 

##What does UEShaderScript do?
UEShaderScript is a free Blender Plugin designed to be used with UModel: https://www.gildor.org/en/projects/umodel#files and Befzz's psk/psa importer: https://github.com/Befzz/blender3d_import_psk_psa
The plugin allows for one click texturing for all selected meshes and is built for 3d assets exported from Unreal Engine. 

The plugin does three things:
1. Comes with default shader map presets for Dead By Daylight and Home Sweet Home Survive. We are still looking for shader maps! 
Again find me on my discord here: https://discord.gg/rkkWSH2EMz to send me screenshots of shader maps you want to be included in the default presets!

2. Adds the ability to save shader maps and mark which image texture nodes should load an image and dynamically load image textures to them.

3. Adds the ability to load shader maps and their respective image textures based on a props.txt file exported from UModel: https://www.gildor.org/en/projects/umodel#files
